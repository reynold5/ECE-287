Project Title: Morse Code to English Translator
Equipment Used: Altera DE2-115 FPGA, Quartus

This is part of a final progect for our ECE 287-Digital Systems Design class.  This project takes Morse Code inputs from the user,
through 4 switches located on the FPGA, and translates the input into it's English text component via the seven segment displays 
on the FPGA. This project required the use of VHDL.
